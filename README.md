# Movies_ETL

## Overview 
Amazing Prime loves the dataset created during this week's module and wants to keep it updated on a daily basis. Britta needs your help to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. Together we refactored the code from this module to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

## Method 
This challenege excercise was comprised of four excercises, each a checkpoint on the road to extracting, tranforming and loading the data into a database. 

Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files

Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data

Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data

Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database
